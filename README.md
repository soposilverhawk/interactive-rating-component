## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating


### Links

- Live Site URL: [https://soposilverhawk.github.io/interactive-rating-component/]

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow


### What I learned

During this project, I learnt how to store data locally in a browser using localstorage, as well as how to transmit it from one page to another. Apart from that, I learnt how to prevent default form submission procedure in order to not lose the user-inputted information on the page and enhance user experience. I learnt how to check for existing localstorage data and some of the code that I'm proud of, is my conditional check of localstorage existence using the next line

```js
if(typeOf(Storage) !== "undefined") {
    // some logic
}
```


### Continued development

I feel this project gives me an opportunity to further delve into localstorage and working with forms more appropriately as it familiarized me with the core concepts of each.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) - This helped me to familiarize myself with the basic functioning of localStorage and its methods as I have not used it extensively in my previous projects.
